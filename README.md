# GymCoreApp - Track Your Gym Progress!

GymCoreApp is an application designed to help you keep track of your gym workouts, including the number of sets, repetitions, and weights lifted. This app was developed as a portfolio project to showcase and demonstrate expertise in Angular. It serves as a frontend client for another application GymCore Backend: [https://github.com/jakubmorawski8/GymCore](https://github.com/jakubmorawski8/GymCore) I built using .NET technology, which acts as the backend.

- **Services:** Implementing services to handle business logic and data manipulation separate from components.
- **Interpolation:** Using interpolation to bind data and dynamically display content in the templates.
- **Pipes:** Utilizing both standard and custom pipes to format and transform data for better presentation.
- **Question Mark Operator:** Employing the safe navigation operator to handle potential null or undefined values.

- **Event Binding:** Handling user interactions and triggering actions in response to events.
- **Template Reference:** Leveraging template reference variables to access and manipulate DOM elements.
- **ngModel - Two-Way Binding:** Implementing two-way data binding using ngModel for real-time data synchronization.
- **Lifecycle Hooks:** Understanding and using component lifecycle hooks to perform actions at specific stages of a component's lifecycle.
- **RxJS - Observable, Subject, Subscribe, Unsubscribe:** Working with RxJS to manage asynchronous operations and handle data streams.
- **Routing:** Setting up routing to navigate between different views and components within the application.
- **Error Handling:** Implementing error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage exceptions and provide meaningful feedback to users.

These skills have significantly contributed to the successful completion of GymCoreApp and have enhanced my proficiency in Angular development.
